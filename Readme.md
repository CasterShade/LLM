# Model Size Requirements (VRAM, RAM, Storage) for LLMs

**VRAM & RAM Needs by Model Size:** The memory requirements grow quickly with model parameter count. A roughly 7-billion-parameter (7B) model typically requires about 14–16 GB of GPU memory (VRAM) if loaded at full 16-bit precision ([GPU Requirements Guide for DeepSeek Models (V3, All Variants)](https://apxml.com/posts/system-requirements-deepseek-models#:~:text=Model%20Variant%20Parameters%20VRAM%20,386%20GB)). However, using quantization (lower precision) can shrink this dramatically – 4-bit quantization brings a 7B model down to around 3.9–4 GB ([GPU Requirements Guide for DeepSeek Models (V3, All Variants)](https://apxml.com/posts/system-requirements-deepseek-models#:~:text=Model%20Variant%20Parameters%20VRAM%20,386%20GB)) ([llama.cpp/examples/quantize/README.md at master · ggml-org/llama.cpp · GitHub](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/blob/master/examples/quantize/README.md#:~:text=Model%20Original%20size%20Quantized%20size,5%20GB)), which is small enough for consumer GPUs (and even CPU RAM). In practice, **Llama 2** 7B or **DeepSeek 7B** models need roughly **~4 GB VRAM** when 4-bit quantized (or ~16 GB in full precision) ([GPU Requirements Guide for DeepSeek Models (V3, All Variants)](https://apxml.com/posts/system-requirements-deepseek-models#:~:text=Model%20Variant%20Parameters%20VRAM%20,386%20GB)). For **13B models**, expect roughly double that: about **7.8–8 GB** in 4-bit form, or ~24–30 GB in full precision ([llama.cpp/examples/quantize/README.md at master · ggml-org/llama.cpp · GitHub](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/blob/master/examples/quantize/README.md#:~:text=Model%20Original%20size%20Quantized%20size,5%20GB)). This means a 13B model can **just fit on a 10–12 GB VRAM GPU** when quantized ([Llama-2 LLM: All Versions & Hardware Requirements – Hardware Corner](https://www.hardware-corner.net/llm-database/Llama-2/#:~:text=For%20beefier%20models%20like%20the,available%20to%20run%20it%20smoothly)) (and would need at least a 24 GB card for full precision). Moving up to **30B–33B models** pushes memory higher: around **19–20 GB** with 4-bit weights, or a hefty ~60 GB in 16-bit form ([llama.cpp/examples/quantize/README.md at master · ggml-org/llama.cpp · GitHub](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/blob/master/examples/quantize/README.md#:~:text=Model%20Original%20size%20Quantized%20size,5%20GB)). In other words, a 30B model demands a high-VRAM GPU (20+ GB) or must be run partly from CPU memory. Truly large models like **65B–70B** params are *out of reach for single GPUs* – even 4-bit quantized they’re ~35–40 GB ([llama.cpp/examples/quantize/README.md at master · ggml-org/llama.cpp · GitHub](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/blob/master/examples/quantize/README.md#:~:text=Model%20Original%20size%20Quantized%20size,5%20GB)). These would require multi-GPU setups or offloading to large system RAM (at least 64–128 GB of RAM for CPU inference) ([Llama-2 LLM: All Versions & Hardware Requirements – Hardware Corner](https://www.hardware-corner.net/llm-database/Llama-2/#:~:text=For%2065B%20and%2070B%20Parameter,Models)) ([Llama-2 LLM: All Versions & Hardware Requirements – Hardware Corner](https://www.hardware-corner.net/llm-database/Llama-2/#:~:text=GPU%20with%20at%20least%2040GB,the%2065B%20and%2070B%20models)).

**Storage Footprint:** The on-disk size of model files also scales with parameters. For example, a Llama2 7B model is about **13 GB** in its original form, which compresses to ~**3.9–4 GB** when saved in 4-bit quantized format ([llama.cpp/examples/quantize/README.md at master · ggml-org/llama.cpp · GitHub](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/blob/master/examples/quantize/README.md#:~:text=Model%20Original%20size%20Quantized%20size,5%20GB)). A 13B model might occupy ~**24 GB** uncompressed, or ~**7–8 GB** quantized ([llama.cpp/examples/quantize/README.md at master · ggml-org/llama.cpp · GitHub](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/blob/master/examples/quantize/README.md#:~:text=Model%20Original%20size%20Quantized%20size,5%20GB)). By 30B, the model can be ~**60 GB** (full) or ~**20 GB** (quantized) ([llama.cpp/examples/quantize/README.md at master · ggml-org/llama.cpp · GitHub](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/blob/master/examples/quantize/README.md#:~:text=Model%20Original%20size%20Quantized%20size,5%20GB)). This means you’ll want a fast, large SSD to store these models. **Plan on at least a few tens of GB per model** (e.g. ~4 GB for a quantized 7B, ~8 GB for 13B, ~20 GB for 30B) plus working space. If you intend to keep multiple models (chat, base, various fine-tunes), a **500 GB to 1 TB SSD** is recommended so you’re not constantly shuffling files. Fast NVMe storage is ideal, as it speeds up loading these multi-gigabyte model files into memory ([Building an LLM-Optimized Linux Server on a Budget](https://linuxblog.io/build-llm-linux-server-on-budget/#:~:text=large%20models%20when%20offloading%20to,for%20airflow%2C%20I%20own%20this)). In short, **7B and 13B models** are on the order of gigabytes, while **30B+ models** can be tens of GB, so storage and memory must scale accordingly.

**CPU vs GPU Memory:** It’s worth noting that you can run these models on CPU alone if you have enough normal RAM, but it’s much slower. For instance, a 7B model in CPU-optimized format might need ~4 GB of RAM ([Llama-2 LLM: All Versions & Hardware Requirements – Hardware Corner](https://www.hardware-corner.net/llm-database/Llama-2/#:~:text=If%20the%207B%20Llama,to%20run%20that%20one%20smoothly)), and a 13B model ~8 GB RAM ([Llama-2 LLM: All Versions & Hardware Requirements – Hardware Corner](https://www.hardware-corner.net/llm-database/Llama-2/#:~:text=GPU%20with%20at%20least%2010,available%20to%20run%20it%20smoothly)). However, inference speed on CPU will be far lower than on a GPU. Therefore, a common strategy is to use **GPU VRAM for as much of the model as possible**, and spill over to CPU RAM if needed (many frameworks like Ollama or llama.cpp support offloading portions of the model to system memory). As a rule of thumb, ensure your **GPU VRAM + available RAM ≥ total model size** ([Hardware requirements for running the full size deepseek R1 with ...](https://www.reddit.com/r/ollama/comments/1icv7wv/hardware_requirements_for_running_the_full_size/#:~:text=,to%20be%20at%20least%2080GB)). For example, a 30B quantized model (~20 GB) could run on a 16 GB GPU if ~4 GB is offloaded to system RAM (you’d want >20 GB of RAM in that case). Having ample RAM (32 GB, 64 GB, etc.) is especially useful when your GPU doesn’t have enough VRAM – it allows you to still *run* larger models by storing the extra weights in RAM ([Building an LLM-Optimized Linux Server on a Budget](https://linuxblog.io/build-llm-linux-server-on-budget/#:~:text=,for%20airflow%2C%20I%20own%20this)) (with some speed penalty). In summary, **smaller 7B–13B models** can work on consumer GPUs (8–16 GB VRAM) or even CPU with enough RAM, whereas **30B+ models** push into territory that needs high-end GPUs or significant system memory.

# Hardware Recommendations (Budget-Friendly Configurations)

When building a cost-effective setup for local LLMs, the goal is to balance **sufficient memory (VRAM/RAM)** with raw compute, while staying within $500–$2000. Here are recommended hardware configurations, from entry-level to high-end of the budget, which enable efficient inference and even fine-tuning of models like DeepSeek 7B and others:

### **Entry-Level Config (~$600–$800)** – *Good for 7B models, basic 13B*

- **GPU:** Aim for a **GPU with at least 8–12 GB VRAM**. This is the minimum to comfortably load 7B and smaller 13B models. Examples include an NVIDIA **RTX 3060 12GB** or even a used older card like an **RTX 2080 Ti (11GB)**. A 12GB GPU can run 7B and 13B parameter models in 4-bit quantized form (13B *GPTQ* models need ~10 GB VRAM) ([Llama-2 LLM: All Versions & Hardware Requirements – Hardware Corner](https://www.hardware-corner.net/llm-database/Llama-2/#:~:text=For%20beefier%20models%20like%20the,available%20to%20run%20it%20smoothly)). These cards are relatively affordable and allow running a Llama-2 13B or DeepSeek 7B *inference* on GPU. They also suffice for lightweight fine-tuning – e.g. using QLoRA (4-bit training), a 13B model can be fine-tuned on a 12GB card ([Helpful VRAM requirement table for qlora, lora, and full finetuning. : r/LocalLLaMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/18o5u0k/helpful_vram_requirement_table_for_qlora_lora_and/#:~:text=Method%20%20Bits%20%207B,24GB%20%2048GB%20%2032GB)). If a GPU upgrade isn’t feasible initially, you could even start CPU-only; just ensure you have high RAM (and expect slow speeds). But **for ~$300 or less**, a 10–12GB used GPU is a huge performance boost.

- **CPU:** A mid-range **6 to 8-core CPU** is plenty. LLM inference is not extremely CPU-bound (the GPU does the heavy lifting), but you need decent single-thread performance and enough cores to handle background tasks and model serving overhead. Something like an **AMD Ryzen 5 5600X** or **Intel Core i5-13400F** (or even older i7/Ryzen 7 from a generation or two ago) gives a good balance. These CPUs (65–105W TDP range ([AMD Ryzen™ 9 5900X Desktop Processor](https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/desktops/ryzen/5000-series/amd-ryzen-9-5900x.html#:~:text=Default%20TDP%3A%20105W,PIB%29%3A%20Not%20Included))) won’t bottleneck an entry GPU and keep the build cost low.

- **Memory (RAM):** **16 GB RAM is an absolute minimum**, but **32 GB is recommended** if you can afford it. With 16 GB, you can just manage a 7B model and OS overhead; 32 GB provides headroom to load a 13B model entirely into RAM if needed and for general multitasking. Also, if you plan to run slightly larger or multiple models on CPU, more RAM helps. Luckily, DDR4 RAM is affordable – e.g. 32 GB DDR4 could be under $100. Ensure the motherboard has **free RAM slots** for future upgrades (e.g. get 2×8 GB now, upgrade with 2×8 GB later to hit 32 GB, or 2×16->64 GB later).

- **Storage:** Prioritize a **fast SSD**, at least **512 GB NVMe**. Even on a tight budget, a 512 GB M.2 NVMe drive (~$50–$70) is worthwhile for storing model data. This size can hold a few quantized models (each a few GB to tens of GB) comfortably. Fast read speeds shorten the initial model load time. For example, a PCIe 4.0 NVMe can load a model noticeably faster than an HDD ([Building an LLM-Optimized Linux Server on a Budget](https://linuxblog.io/build-llm-linux-server-on-budget/#:~:text=large%20models%20when%20offloading%20to,for%20airflow%2C%20I%20own%20this)). If budget permits, 1 TB provides more breathing room, especially if you’ll fine-tune (which generates new model checkpoints). In short, **SSD > HDD** for AI work, and get as much capacity as you can within budget.

- **Example Build:** A system with a used **RTX 3060 12GB**, a Ryzen 5 or Core i5, 32 GB DDR4, and 1 TB NVMe SSD can often be assembled for around $700–$800 by savvy shopping (used GPU, mid-tier new CPU). This would capably run **DeepSeek 7B** and other 7–13B models locally ([Private Deployment of Ollama + DeepSeek + Dify: Build Your Own AI Assistant | Dify](https://docs.dify.ai/learn-more/use-cases/private-ai-ollama-deepseek-dify#:~:text=Hardware%20Requirements%3A)) ([Llama-2 LLM: All Versions & Hardware Requirements – Hardware Corner](https://www.hardware-corner.net/llm-database/Llama-2/#:~:text=For%20beefier%20models%20like%20the,available%20to%20run%20it%20smoothly)). Fine-tuning a 7B model (e.g. via LoRA/QLoRA) is feasible on this setup since it needs ~6 GB GPU memory ([Helpful VRAM requirement table for qlora, lora, and full finetuning. : r/LocalLLaMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/18o5u0k/helpful_vram_requirement_table_for_qlora_lora_and/#:~:text=Method%20%20Bits%20%207B,24GB%20%2048GB%20%2032GB)). This entry build is also *scalable*: you can later add more RAM or swap in a better GPU as your needs grow.

### **Mid-Range Config (~$1200–$1500)** – *Balanced for 13B and some 30B models*

- **GPU:** At this level, invest in a **higher VRAM, faster GPU**. Options include NVIDIA’s **RTX 4070 (12GB)** or **RTX 3080 12GB**, or AMD’s **RX 7900 XT (20GB)**. The ideal is to get **≥16 GB VRAM** if possible, as this opens the door to running 30B-class models. For example, AMD’s 7900 XT offers 20 GB of VRAM for around $800–$900 new, which is great value per GB ([Building an LLM-Optimized Linux Server on a Budget](https://linuxblog.io/build-llm-linux-server-on-budget/#:~:text=large%20models%20when%20offloading%20to,for%20airflow%2C%20I%20own%20this)). A GPU with ~20 GB can comfortably hold a 30B-parameter model quantized (~15–20 GB) in memory, enabling reasonably fast inference. NVIDIA alternatives in this price range might have 12–16 GB (e.g. RTX 4080 16GB if found near $1200, or a used **RTX 3090 24GB** around $800). A **24GB card** (like the RTX 3090) is actually recommended for full 7B FP16 models ([GPU Requirements Guide for DeepSeek Models (V3, All Variants)](https://apxml.com/posts/system-requirements-deepseek-models#:~:text=Model%20Variant%20Recommended%20GPUs%20,6x%20or%20more)) and provides ample room for 4-bit 30B models. In practice, a 12–16 GB GPU limits you to ~13B models for full-speed GPU inference ([Llama-2 LLM: All Versions & Hardware Requirements – Hardware Corner](https://www.hardware-corner.net/llm-database/Llama-2/#:~:text=For%20beefier%20models%20like%20the,available%20to%20run%20it%20smoothly)), whereas 20+ GB lets you venture into 30B territory. So, within this budget, **maximize VRAM** – it directly affects what models you can run.

- **CPU:** A **8 to 12-core CPU** is suitable here. For instance, an **AMD Ryzen 7 7700X** or **Ryzen 9 5900X**, or an Intel **Core i7-13700F**, gives you strong multi-threaded performance (helpful for data loading, running multiple processes, etc.) and doesn’t break the bank. The Ryzen 9 5900X (12-core) is around ~$300 and supports PCIe 4.0 for fast GPU and SSD throughput ([Building an LLM-Optimized Linux Server on a Budget](https://linuxblog.io/build-llm-linux-server-on-budget/#:~:text=,%2475)). It has a 105W TDP ([AMD Ryzen™ 9 5900X Desktop Processor](https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/desktops/ryzen/5000-series/amd-ryzen-9-5900x.html#:~:text=Default%20TDP%3A%20105W,PIB%29%3A%20Not%20Included)), meaning it’s power-hungry but manageable with good cooling. Overall, at this budget, the CPU should not be the limiting factor – any modern mid/high chip will handle LLM serving while the GPU does the heavy compute.

- **Memory (RAM):** **32 GB is the baseline, 64 GB preferable**. With models like 30B, having more system RAM is useful, because you may need to offload parts of the model or work with large datasets for fine-tuning. For example, if you try to run a 30B model on a 16 GB GPU, the remaining ~4 GB can sit in system RAM (so you’d want >20 GB free) ([Building an LLM-Optimized Linux Server on a Budget](https://linuxblog.io/build-llm-linux-server-on-budget/#:~:text=,for%20airflow%2C%20I%20own%20this)). If you plan on fine-tuning or running multiple models, 64 GB ensures you won’t run out of memory. DDR4 is still an option if using a slightly older platform (cheaper to get 64 GB DDR4 than DDR5). If you go with a newer DDR5 platform, consider starting with 32 GB and ensuring the board has free slots to add another 32 GB later.

- **Storage:** **1 TB NVMe SSD** at this tier, as you’ll likely accumulate more models and data. In addition to model files, fine-tuning will produce checkpoints and logs – which can easily consume tens of GB. A 1 TB PCIe 4.0 SSD (which can be found ~$100) offers high I/O for AI workloads (e.g., reading a large dataset for training, or swapping model memory). You might also add a secondary cheap SATA SSD or HDD for archival of older models or datasets, but keep active projects on the NVMe. 

- **Example Build:** One could build a mid-range system with, say, an **RTX 3080 12GB or RX 7900 XT 20GB** GPU, an **AMD Ryzen 9 5900X** CPU, **64 GB DDR4** RAM, and **1 TB NVMe**, in the ballpark of $1300–$1500. Such a system can **run 13B models at full speed** and handle **30B models with 4-bit compression** (especially if using the 20GB GPU) ([llama.cpp/examples/quantize/README.md at master · ggml-org/llama.cpp · GitHub](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/blob/master/examples/quantize/README.md#:~:text=7B%2013%20GB%203,5%20GB)). It’s also well-suited to *fine-tune 13B models* via QLoRA (which needs ~12 GB VRAM) ([Helpful VRAM requirement table for qlora, lora, and full finetuning. : r/LocalLLaMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/18o5u0k/helpful_vram_requirement_table_for_qlora_lora_and/#:~:text=Freeze%20%2016%20%2020GB,24GB%20%2048GB%20%2032GB)) and even attempt 30B fine-tunes if 20+ GB VRAM is available (QLoRA on 30B needs ~24 GB) ([Helpful VRAM requirement table for qlora, lora, and full finetuning. : r/LocalLLaMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/18o5u0k/helpful_vram_requirement_table_for_qlora_lora_and/#:~:text=Freeze%20%2016%20%2020GB,24GB%20%2048GB%20%2032GB)). Importantly, this build has **clear upgrade paths**: you could drop in a higher-tier GPU later (the PSU and case should accommodate that), or expand RAM further if working with 65B models via CPU memory.

### **High-End Config (~$1800–$2000)** – *Maximal setup for 30B+ and fast fine-tuning*

- **GPU:** Allocate a major chunk of the budget to the **GPU with very high VRAM**. In this range, options include the **NVIDIA RTX 3090 or 4090 (24 GB)**, or AMD’s **Radeon RX 7900 XTX (24 GB)**. A 24 GB GPU gives a lot of freedom – you can load a 30B model fully in 4-bit (needs ~24 GB) ([Helpful VRAM requirement table for qlora, lora, and full finetuning. : r/LocalLLaMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/18o5u0k/helpful_vram_requirement_table_for_qlora_lora_and/#:~:text=Freeze%20%2016%20%2020GB,24GB%20%2048GB%20%2032GB)), or even experiment with 65B models by combining 4-bit and CPU offloading (24 GB on GPU + remainder in RAM). The **RTX 4090** is top-of-line with 24 GB, but it often costs ~$1600 alone (and thus might exceed the $2000 total after other parts). The **RTX 3090 (24GB)**, on the other hand, can be found used or on sale around $800–$1000 and is a popular choice for local LLM enthusiasts due to its large VRAM. It was recommended for running 7B models at full precision (since 16 GB out of 24 covers the model) ([GPU Requirements Guide for DeepSeek Models (V3, All Variants)](https://apxml.com/posts/system-requirements-deepseek-models#:~:text=Model%20Variant%20Recommended%20GPUs%20,6x%20or%20more)) and is generally capable for up to 30B quantized models. AMD’s RX 7900 XTX is another compelling choice, often ~$1000 new for 24 GB; it offers very high memory bandwidth which benefits LLM inference speeds ([The Poor Man's Local LLM: High-Powered AI Without the High Price Tag - DigiAlps LTD](https://digialps.com/the-poor-mans-local-llm-high-powered-ai-without-the-high-price-tag/#:~:text=,for%20a%20fraction%20of%20that)) ([The Poor Man's Local LLM: High-Powered AI Without the High Price Tag - DigiAlps LTD](https://digialps.com/the-poor-mans-local-llm-high-powered-ai-without-the-high-price-tag/#:~:text=Model%20Token%20Size%20Tokens%20per,4%2014.7B%2020%20TK%2Fs)). If you choose AMD, ensure your software stack supports ROCm or use frameworks like Ollama/llama.cpp which can utilize AMD cards. In summary, **24 GB VRAM is the target** here – it “future proofs” you for most open-source models (only the 65B+ class would then require multi-GPU or partial CPU usage).

- **CPU:** Go for a **high-core-count CPU**, especially if you envision multitasking or heavier fine-tuning workloads. An example is **AMD Ryzen 9 7900X** (12-core, latest gen) or even stepping up to 16-core (Ryzen 9 7950X) if within budget. These CPUs ($400–$600 range) offer strong performance in data pre-processing and can handle running multiple model instances. Another route is **server/workstation chips** (e.g. older Xeon or Threadripper used) if you need more memory channels and don’t mind higher power draw – though for most, a mainstream desktop 12-16 core is sufficient. The key is that it shouldn’t be the limiting factor: with a $2k build, you can afford a CPU that *easily feeds a 3090/4090*. For instance, a Ryzen 9 7900X has better single-thread and multithread speed than the 5900X and supports newer IO like PCIe 5.0 ([Building an LLM-Optimized Linux Server on a Budget](https://linuxblog.io/build-llm-linux-server-on-budget/#:~:text=,%241400)), which can be slightly more “future-proof.” In any case, ensure robust cooling (a ~$30 tower air cooler can handle a 12-core chip ([Building an LLM-Optimized Linux Server on a Budget](https://linuxblog.io/build-llm-linux-server-on-budget/#:~:text=,%2475)) if not overclocked) and a motherboard that supports your memory and GPU needs (adequate PCIe lanes, etc.).

- **Memory (RAM):** **64 GB or even 128 GB RAM** is advisable at this tier. While 64 GB system memory is usually enough for handling one 65B model offloaded (which needs ~40 GB RAM in 4-bit plus overhead) ([Llama-2 LLM: All Versions & Hardware Requirements – Hardware Corner](https://www.hardware-corner.net/llm-database/Llama-2/#:~:text=When%20you%20step%20up%20to,the%2065B%20and%2070B%20models)), going to 128 GB gives you a cushion to run multiple large models or do more in-memory data processing. The good news is that large RAM kits have become more affordable – e.g. **128 GB DDR4-3600 (~$240)** was used in one highly optimized $2k build ([Building an LLM-Optimized Linux Server on a Budget](https://linuxblog.io/build-llm-linux-server-on-budget/#:~:text=,for%20airflow%2C%20I%20own%20this)). Large RAM not only helps with running huge models via CPU offload, but also with fine-tuning (the optimizer states for full 30B fine-tunes would be enormous, though typically we use memory-efficient fine-tuning like LoRA). Even for inference, having, say, 128 GB means you could potentially load a quantized 65B model (which is ~38 GB) entirely in RAM if the GPU can’t hold it, albeit at reduced speed. In short, **max out RAM within budget** – you’ll gain the flexibility to handle “medium to large models when offloading to RAM” ([Building an LLM-Optimized Linux Server on a Budget](https://linuxblog.io/build-llm-linux-server-on-budget/#:~:text=,for%20airflow%2C%20I%20own%20this)). If using DDR5, note that high-capacity kits (like 4×32 GB for 128 GB) are pricier; an alternative is sticking with a DDR4 platform (e.g. an LGA1700 board that takes DDR4 or an AM4 Threadripper) to get 128 GB cheaper.

- **Storage:** **At least 1–2 TB NVMe SSD**. With high-end gear, you’ll likely experiment with many models and fine-tunes. A 2 TB NVMe ensures you can store multiple 30B+ model files and project data. Look for a Gen4 or even Gen5 SSD (somewhat faster, though real-world difference for loading models is modest). Reliability and speed are key; something like a Samsung 970/980 Pro or similar high-end drive is ideal. Additionally, consider a secondary drive for backup or a scratch disk if doing large data processing. But the primary NVMe is where model files and active data should reside for speed.

- **Example Build:** A top-notch example is the one described in a recent guide: **Ryzen 9 5900X + 128 GB DDR4 + Radeon 7900 XT 20GB** all under $2000 ([Building an LLM-Optimized Linux Server on a Budget](https://linuxblog.io/build-llm-linux-server-on-budget/#:~:text=,%2475)) ([Building an LLM-Optimized Linux Server on a Budget](https://linuxblog.io/build-llm-linux-server-on-budget/#:~:text=,for%20airflow%2C%20I%20own%20this)). Our variant might use a 24GB GPU: e.g. a **used RTX 3090 (24GB)** for ~$900, on an **AM4 motherboard with 128 GB DDR4** (~$250), a **5900X CPU** ($300), a 1–2 TB NVMe ($100), and quality PSU/case. This comes out around $1800–$2000 and would let you **run up to 30B models smoothly** (fully in VRAM if quantized) and even try 65B models with combined GPU+RAM (24 GB on the 3090 and ~20+ GB offloaded to system RAM) ([Llama-2 LLM: All Versions & Hardware Requirements – Hardware Corner](https://www.hardware-corner.net/llm-database/Llama-2/#:~:text=For%2065B%20and%2070B%20Parameter,Models)) ([GPU Requirements Guide for DeepSeek Models (V3, All Variants)](https://apxml.com/posts/system-requirements-deepseek-models#:~:text=DeepSeek,6x%20or%20more)). Fine-tuning is also well-supported: with 24 GB VRAM, you could do QLoRA on a 30B model (needs ~24 GB) ([Helpful VRAM requirement table for qlora, lora, and full finetuning. : r/LocalLLaMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/18o5u0k/helpful_vram_requirement_table_for_qlora_lora_and/#:~:text=Freeze%20%2016%20%2020GB,24GB%20%2048GB%20%2032GB)), or even attempt multi-GPU training if you later add another GPU. This high-end config is **scalable for the future** – you have enough PSU and cooling for adding a second GPU or upgrading to a newer 32 GB GPU down the line, and the massive RAM and existing 24 GB VRAM mean you’re set for most open-source LLMs currently available.

# Scalability Considerations (Future Expansion)

When building an LLM rig on a budget, it’s wise to choose components that allow **easy upgrades** as your needs grow:

- **Motherboard & RAM:** Pick a motherboard with **4 RAM slots** (or more) so you aren’t locked into a fixed memory size. For instance, you might start with 2×16 GB (32 GB) and later add 2×16 GB to reach 64 GB instead of replacing sticks. Similarly, ensure the board supports high capacity per slot (e.g. 32 GB UDIMMs) in case you aim for 128+ GB in the future. If going with a newer platform (DDR5), verify that affordable high-capacity kits are available. The idea is to avoid having to replace the entire board or all RAM when upgrading – just drop in more modules.

- **PSU (Power Supply Unit):** Invest in a **high-quality PSU with ample wattage and connectors** up front. GPUs are the most power-hungry component; if there’s any chance you’ll upgrade to, say, an RTX 4090 later (450W draw) or add a second GPU, you’ll want a PSU in the 850W–1000W range. For example, even a single RTX 3090 system is recommended to have a 750W minimum ([graphics card - RTX 3090 Board Power Requirements - Super User](https://superuser.com/questions/1593918/rtx-3090-board-power-requirements#:~:text=NVIDIA%20itself%20is%20more%20optimistic,RTX%203090%20only%20needs%20350W)), and dual GPUs or next-gen cards call for more. A good 850W gold-rated PSU (~$150) now might save you from buying a new PSU later. Also ensure it has the necessary 8-pin (or 12VHPWR) cables for higher-end cards.

- **Case and Cooling:** Choose a **case with enough space and airflow** for upgrades. A larger ATX mid-tower with good ventilation (mesh front, multiple fans) is ideal, especially if you might install a large 3-slot GPU or multiple cards. Adequate airflow will handle the extra heat from more powerful GPUs or added drives. Likewise, opt for a decent CPU cooler now (even if your current CPU is mid-range) so that if you upgrade to a higher TDP CPU, you already have cooling capacity. For example, a popular $100 case with good airflow was used in the $2000 build ([Building an LLM-Optimized Linux Server on a Budget](https://linuxblog.io/build-llm-linux-server-on-budget/#:~:text=high%20VRAM%20bandwidth%20for%20model,%24200)), ensuring the high-end GPU and future add-ons stay cool.

- **GPU Upgradability:** If you start with a lower-end GPU, verify that your motherboard has at least one **x16 PCIe slot** free (most do) and that your case/PSU can accommodate a larger card later. Also, consider multi-GPU: while single-card is simpler for most LLM use, advanced users might use two GPUs for either parallel inference or multi-GPU training. If that’s in your plan, look for a motherboard with two well-spaced PCIe slots (×16/×8), and maybe skip very compact cases. Keep in mind multi-GPU for a single large model (to effectively double VRAM) is possible but requires more complex software setup – scaling usually comes easier by upgrading to one more powerful GPU. Still, leaving the option open (with a compatible board/PSU) can extend the life of your rig.

- **Modular Additions:** Plan for **additional storage** and peripherals. As you dive deeper into LLM projects, you might add a second NVMe drive (ensure the board has an extra M.2 slot) or large HDDs for datasets. USB ports and other I/O for connecting external drives or accelerators (like USB TPUs, etc.) could also matter. Essentially, think of the build like a foundation – core components (CPU/mobo/PSU/case) should be chosen not just to meet today’s needs, but to allow new components to slot in. This way, a budget build can evolve: e.g. start with a modest GPU and 32 GB RAM for a 7B model, then two years later upgrade to a 24 GB GPU and 128 GB RAM to run a 70B model, using the *same* system.

- **Power and Cooling Overhead:** Scalability isn’t just about adding hardware, but also handling it. Higher-tier GPUs and CPUs will draw more power and generate more heat. By slightly **over-spec’ing your cooling and PSU initially**, you ensure the system can scale. For instance, running fans a bit below max now means you can increase cooling later when components run hotter. Similarly, a PSU loaded at 50% now (e.g. a 850W PSU on a system pulling ~400W) will be at ~80–90% load with a future GPU upgrade – still within safe limits. This overhead planning protects your investment and makes upgrades smoother (no surprise shutdowns or thermal throttling).

In summary, a scalable LLM setup should have **headroom in power, space, and memory**. It’s often worth spending a little extra on the **infrastructure** (PSU, case, mobo, cooling) so that down the line you can drop in a new GPU or more RAM without rebuilding from scratch. The configurations above all emphasize components that can be expanded – for example, the mid-range and high-end builds use boards and cases that could take 128 GB RAM or a second GPU, ensuring you can keep up with the growing demands of larger open-source models in the future.

# Power Consumption Estimates

Power usage is an important consideration, both for choosing the right PSU and for managing electricity costs/heat. Here we provide estimated **power draw** for each recommended setup at full load (running an LLM inference or fine-tune, which typically pushes the GPU to 100% and the CPU moderately):

- **Entry-Level (GPU ~8–12GB, e.g. RTX 3060)** – *Approximately 200–250 Watts under load.* The **GPU itself draws about 170 W max** (for RTX 3060 12GB) ([NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 12 GB Specs | TechPowerUp GPU Database](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/geforce-rtx-3060-12-gb.c3682#:~:text=1875%20MHz%20%2815%20Gbps%20effective%29,launch%20was%20329%20US%20Dollars)). The CPU (mid-range 6-core) might draw ~50–75 W during heavy usage. Add ~30–50 W for motherboard, drives, and fans. In total, expect ~250 W peak. Idle power on this system would be much lower (perhaps 50–70 W). A quality 500W–600W PSU is sufficient here. *(Example: An RTX 3060-based system was rated around 170W for the GPU ([NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 12 GB Specs | TechPowerUp GPU Database](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/geforce-rtx-3060-12-gb.c3682#:~:text=1875%20MHz%20%2815%20Gbps%20effective%29,launch%20was%20329%20US%20Dollars)), and with a CPU at ~65W TDP plus overhead, ~250W total is a reasonable maximum.)*

- **Mid-Range (GPU ~16–20GB, e.g. RTX 3080 or RX 7900 XT)** – *Around 350–450 Watts under full load.* A card like NVIDIA’s 3080/3080 Ti or AMD’s 7900 XT will consume roughly 300W (the RX 7900 XT is rated ~300 W TBP ([AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT Specs | TechPowerUp GPU Database](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/radeon-rx-7900-xt.c3912#:~:text=Being%20a%20dual,Display%20outputs%20include%3A)), and the RTX 3080 ~320 W). The CPU (8–12 cores) could draw ~100 W when all threads are active. So GPU (300W) + CPU (100W) + others (~50W) gives ~450W peak. In real-world AI use, the GPU will be maxed out (~300W) and the CPU often less than max, so ~400W is typical. **Plan PSU capacity accordingly** – 750W is generally recommended to have headroom ([graphics card - RTX 3090 Board Power Requirements - Super User](https://superuser.com/questions/1593918/rtx-3090-board-power-requirements#:~:text=NVIDIA%20itself%20is%20more%20optimistic,RTX%203090%20only%20needs%20350W)). *(For reference, AMD specifies the 7900 XTX at 355W TBP ([AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX Specs | TechPowerUp GPU Database](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/radeon-rx-7900-xtx.c3941#:~:text=memory%20interface,launch%20was%20999%20US%20Dollars)) and the slightly cut-down 7900 XT at ~300W TBP ([AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT Specs | TechPowerUp GPU Database](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/radeon-rx-7900-xt.c3912#:~:text=Being%20a%20dual,Display%20outputs%20include%3A)). NVIDIA’s 3090 is nominally 350W ([graphics card - RTX 3090 Board Power Requirements - Super User](https://superuser.com/questions/1593918/rtx-3090-board-power-requirements#:~:text=NVIDIA%20itself%20is%20more%20optimistic,RTX%203090%20only%20needs%20350W)). Thus, mid/high-end single GPUs range 300–350W, which with CPU puts you in the ~400W system draw range.)*

- **High-End (GPU 24GB, e.g. RTX 3090/4090 or RX 7900 XTX)** – *Roughly 500–600 Watts under load.* These flagship GPUs are power-hungry: the **RTX 3090 draws up to ~350 W** in practice ([graphics card - RTX 3090 Board Power Requirements - Super User](https://superuser.com/questions/1593918/rtx-3090-board-power-requirements#:~:text=NVIDIA%20itself%20is%20more%20optimistic,RTX%203090%20only%20needs%20350W)) (NVIDIA’s spec is 350W, but some models can spike higher), and the RTX 4090 can pull ~450 W. AMD’s 7900 XTX is rated 355W and can peak around that or more ([AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX Specs | TechPowerUp GPU Database](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/radeon-rx-7900-xtx.c3941#:~:text=memory%20interface,launch%20was%20999%20US%20Dollars)). A high-core-count CPU (12+ cores) under load might add 100–150 W (especially older gen chips or if overclocked). So a worst-case with a 350W GPU + 150W CPU = 500W, plus ~50W for the rest, totals ~550W. For a 4090-class 450W GPU, total could approach 600W. Therefore, a **1000W PSU is often chosen for such builds** ([Building an LLM-Optimized Linux Server on a Budget](https://linuxblog.io/build-llm-linux-server-on-budget/#:~:text=high%20VRAM%20bandwidth%20for%20model,%24200)) to ensure safe overhead. It’s not that the system constantly draws 600W (in inference it will fluctuate, and idle might still be 60–100W due to these GPUs having higher idle draw), but you want that cushion for stability. *(As a concrete example, dual 8-pin power connectors on a 7900 XTX supply up to ~350W and indeed reviews show ~355W draw in 4K gaming ([AMD RX 7900 XTX Review - KitGuru](https://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/dominic-moass/amd-rx-7900-xtx-review/all/1#:~:text=AMD%20RX%207900%20XTX%20Review,about%2075W%20more%20than)) ([AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX Specs | TechPowerUp GPU Database](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/radeon-rx-7900-xtx.c3941#:~:text=memory%20interface,launch%20was%20999%20US%20Dollars)), which aligns with a ~550W system usage with a powerful CPU. NVIDIA recommends 750W PSU for a single 3090 ([graphics card - RTX 3090 Board Power Requirements - Super User](https://superuser.com/questions/1593918/rtx-3090-board-power-requirements#:~:text=NVIDIA%20itself%20is%20more%20optimistic,RTX%203090%20only%20needs%20350W)), and 850W+ for 4090, to account for those peaks.)*

**Power vs. Performance Trade-off:** Keep in mind that higher-end GPUs are less energy-efficient when maxed out. For instance, an **RX 7900 XTX (~355W)** delivers slightly more LLM throughput than an RTX 4080 (~320W), but at the cost of extra watts ([AMD RX 7900 XTX Review - KitGuru](https://www.kitguru.net/components/graphic-cards/dominic-moass/amd-rx-7900-xtx-review/all/1#:~:text=AMD%20RX%207900%20XTX%20Review,about%2075W%20more%20than)). If power cost or heat is a concern, you might undervolt or power-limit your GPU for better efficiency at some performance loss. At idle or low loads, modern systems downclock significantly – a high-end PC might idle only 10–20W higher than an entry one. It’s the full-load scenario that differentiates them. Ensure your cooling solution can handle sustained power draw (e.g. the high-end ~550W rig will dump a lot of heat into the room when running AI tasks). On the plus side, when the system isn’t running large models, power use drops; you only hit these numbers during intensive AI workloads.

In summary, **budget builds draw ~200–300W**, mid-level ~400W, and top-end ~500–600W when working with LLMs. Always provide some headroom in your PSU (about 1.5× the expected draw is a good rule), and be prepared for the heat output of the higher ranges. These estimates help ensure you have the right power and cooling for smooth, safe operation of your LLM hardware.

# Comparison Table of Configurations

Below is a summary table comparing key hardware specs, the model sizes each setup can handle, and the power usage estimates:

**Notes:** All setups assume using quantization (4-bit like GPTQ/GGUF) for larger models to fit in available memory. “Models Supported” refers to comfortable max sizes for *efficient* use – larger models might run with heavy CPU offloading but with reduced performance. Power figures are estimates for a system under AI load (actual wall power draw) and can vary with specific components. Each configuration is designed with **cost-effectiveness and scalability** in mind – you can start with the base specs and upgrade GPU, RAM, or storage as needed to handle more demanding models in the future.
